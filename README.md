Flight to Satisfaction: Unveiling Insights through
Machine Learning in Airline Passenger Services

Predicting Airline Passenger Satisfaction
with High Accuracy a critical benchmark for any airline, directly
impacting loyalty, brand perception, and ultimately, profitability.
Accurately predicting satisfaction levels allows airlines to tailor
their services and interventions more effectively, enhancing the
overall passenger experience. This paper explores the application
of machine learning models for predicting airline passenger
satisfaction, with a specific focus on the performance of Random
Forest classifiers.
Utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing various passenger demographics, travel details, and recorded feedback, we
analyzed and compared the performance of several supervised
learning algorithms. Our investigation revealed that Random
Forest classifiers, known for their ensemble learning approach,
achieved the highest prediction accuracy, reaching an impressive
96%. This significantly outperformed other models, including
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random
Forests, highlighting the effectiveness of Random Forest for this
specific task.
The paper delves deeper into the Random Forest model and
other machine learning modelâ€™s internal workings, uncovering
the most influential factors contributing to passenger satisfaction.
Insights from feature importance analysis shed light on key
aspects, such as flight delays, onboard service quality, ticket price
competitiveness, and passenger demographics. Understanding
these drivers allows airlines to prioritize improvement efforts
in areas with the highest impact on passenger sentiment.
